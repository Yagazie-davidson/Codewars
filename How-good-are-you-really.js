// There was a test in your class and you passed it. Congratulations!
// But you're an ambitious person. You want to know if you're better than the average student in your class.
// You receive an array with your peers' test scores. Now calculate the average and compare your score!
// Return True if you're better, else False!

// Your points are not included in the array of your class's points. For calculating the average point you may add your point to the given array!

function betterThanAverage(classPoints, yourPoints) {
  // Your code here
  classPoints.push(yourPoints);
  sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < classPoints.length; i++) {
    sum += classPoints[i];
  }
  let average = sum / classPoints.length;
  return yourPoints > average;
}
